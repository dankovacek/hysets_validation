  Description:
    Abstract: This data set is a polygon shapefile representing shoreline defined as the zero contour at Mean High Water for the states of Oregon and Washington, and southern British Columbia, Canada.
    Purpose:
      This data set is one of a collection of spatially referenced digital files in a geographic information system related to the Seaside, Oregon, Tsunami Pilot Study.

      Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Federal Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) guidelines do not currently exist for conducting and incorporating tsunami hazard assessments that reflect the substantial advances in tsunami research achieved in the last two decades (Tsunami Pilot Study Working Group, 2006). Therefore, as part of the FEMA Modernization Program, a Tsunami Pilot Study was carried out in the Seaside/Gearhart, Oregon, area to provide information from which tsunami mapping guidelines could be developed. This area was chosen because it is typical of coastal communities in the section of the Pacific Coast from Cape Mendocino to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. There was also considerable interest shown by state agencies and local stakeholders in mapping the tsunami threat to this region. The study was an interagency effort by scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the University of Southern California, and the Middle East Technical University.  We present the GIS data from that report in this publication.

      These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public.  The data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display geologic and oceanographic information.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: COASTLINE.  A vector polyline shapefile of coastline was developed to represent the Mean High Water line.  The shapefile was developed based on a culmination of data sources.  The latest and most accurate data superseded older data sets.  Orthophotos were used as visual assessment of the final vector line.
