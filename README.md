BC Streamflow Monitoring Network Analysis
=========================================

Introduction
------------

Large sample hydrometric datasets have a key role as input in
hydrological studies (Addor et al. 2020; Gupta et al. 2014; Klingler,
Schulz, and Herrnegger 2021) in both process-based and machine learning
approaches, so the interpretation and validation of the basin attributes
used as model input speaks for itself. Kratzert et al. (2019) used the
large sample hydrologic dataset CAMELS (Addor et al. 2017) in a machine
learning model for rainfall-runoff prediction in ungauged basins. Other
efforts in generating large sample datasets attribute sets similar to
CAMELS quickly followed (Alvarez-Garreton et al. 2018; Coxon et al.
2020; Fowler et al. 2021).

Arsenault et al. (2020) developed [HYSETS](https://osf.io/rpc3w/), a
large-sample dataset of over 14K hydrometric monitoring stations in
North America and Mexico. This repo presents a method of replicating the
attributes derived for the Arsenault et al. (2020) study, from
collecting the source spatial data, to deriving catchments, to deriving
basin attributes and comparing to the values derived in the study.
